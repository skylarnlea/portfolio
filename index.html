                <h2>Hi, I'm Skylar!</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my personal space! I'm passionate about simplifying others' lives and 
                    have been working in the healthcare field for over 10 years and Software Engineering 
                    for over one year.</p>
                <p>In my spare time, I enjoy working out, an iced coffee, spending time with my 
                    husband and daughter, and doing a difficult puzzle. I strive to make my clients' 
                    visions become reality in the most efficient and simplified form.</p>

                        <strong>Restaurant Reservations Application:</strong> This full-stack web 
                        application creates a reservation system for restaurant personnel to utilize 
                        when a customer calls to request a reservation. This includes creating new 
                        reservations, editing existing reservations, searching for reservations, booking 
                        and seating reservations, cancelling reservations, and "finishing" reservations 
                        once those guests have completed their dining experience. 
                        The application includes testing, error-handling, routes, and validation middleware. Migrations 
                        and seeds were created using Knex, alongside controllers and services to connect 
                        to and query the PostgreSQL database. Both the server and client sides were 
                        deployed through Render - <a href="https://restaurant-reservation-app-project.onrender.com/dashboard">take a look</a>.

                        <strong>Flashcard Application:</strong> Teachers will use this application to create decks of flash cards for the subjects that 
                        they teach, and students will study the decks. Users can create and delete decks, cards, and study decks of cards as well.
                        This application involves React functionn components, creating routes, using hooks, and debugging React code -

                        <strong>React Recipe Application:</strong> This project, is a recipe-tracking app that allows a user to add a new recipe, 
                        display a list of current recipes, and delete a recipe from the list by clicking a Delete button.
                        This application tested my ability to work with rendering and state management using React - <a href="https://updated-recipe-app.onrender.com/"> take a look</a>.
